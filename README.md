# PYCHAT
Pychat is a chat system for communication across a LAN network. Could be implemented on a vps to make it accessible anywhere. This is build on python socket system to create server and send and receive data. The messages are encrypted using fernet from 100 randomly generated keys but isn't very secure. Use at your own risk. To encrypt/ decrypt, users must have the same keys.
